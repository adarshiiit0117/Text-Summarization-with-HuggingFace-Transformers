# Summarization-with-HuggingFace-Transformers
This project leverages Hugging Face's transformer models T5 for automatic text summarization. The model condenses long pieces of text into concise summaries while retaining key information. The implementation demonstrates how to use pre-trained models for text summarization tasks, making it easy to apply to various types of textual data.
